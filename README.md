<h1>Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Limit Order Books</h1>

In this project, we present the work of Zhang et al in predicting maket movements using Deep Learning methods on a Limit Order Book. We further improve this work by adding a self attention layer and by training the model on Order Flow data.
